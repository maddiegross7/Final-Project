This challenge reflection:
Okay I get the point of this project but honestly it was poorly timed and I felt unnecessary with all that was happening this week
this was the last thing I wanted to worry about because I have 3 exams this superball lab and the engineering expo and this just did not 
seem that important, we tried our best to get something started but what we have is a reflection of the amount of time we had to begin this
I think that the thought to get us started early was nice but I would have been fine to start after fall break. sorry this seems a little
passive aggressive reading this now but I am tired and still have lots to do tonight :)
