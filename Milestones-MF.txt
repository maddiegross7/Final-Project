Reflection: 
The fact that this challenge was so early in the semester really helped me get ahead for the final, and gave me a chance to talk with my group members. I appreciate this especially since I am prone to procrastinating. However, the timing of this challenge was not ideal considering I, along with many other students, have three exams AND the engineering expo AND superball all due this week. I don't understand why this couldn't have waited until after fall break, but I'm sure you have your reasons:)
